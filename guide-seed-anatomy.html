          <h2 id="b-what-is" class="anim-fade-in">What Is a Seed Phrase?</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>A seed phrase (also called a <strong>mnemonic phrase</strong> or <strong>recovery phrase</strong>) is a set of <strong>12 to 24 English words</strong> that serves as the master backup for your entire cryptocurrency wallet. These words are selected from a standardized list of exactly 2,048 words defined by the <strong>BIP39 specification</strong> &mdash; an open standard adopted by virtually every modern wallet.</p>
            <blockquote><p>Think of a seed phrase like the master key to an entire building. From this single key, every room key (private key) and every lock (address) can be regenerated. Lose the master key, and every room becomes permanently inaccessible.</p></blockquote>
            <p>Unlike a traditional password, a seed phrase cannot be reset or recovered by a support team. There is no "forgot password" mechanism in self-custody crypto. If you lose your seed phrase and your wallet device is destroyed, your funds are gone forever &mdash; locked on the blockchain with no way to access them.</p>
            <h3>Why 12 or 24 Words?</h3>
            <p>The word count directly corresponds to the amount of <strong>randomness (entropy)</strong> used to generate the phrase. More words means more entropy and a larger space of possible combinations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>12 words</strong> &mdash; 128 bits of entropy (standard security)</li>
              <li><strong>15 words</strong> &mdash; 160 bits of entropy</li>
              <li><strong>18 words</strong> &mdash; 192 bits of entropy</li>
              <li><strong>24 words</strong> &mdash; 256 bits of entropy (maximum security)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For most users, 12 words provides more than sufficient security. 24 words is often recommended for high-value holdings where maximum entropy is desired.</p>

          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>Your wallet does not pick words at random from a dictionary. Instead, it uses a rigorous, deterministic process rooted in cryptography:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>A <strong>cryptographically secure random number generator</strong> (CSPRNG) produces a sequence of random bits called <em>entropy</em> &mdash; for example, 128 random bits for a 12-word phrase</li>
              <li>A <strong>SHA-256 checksum</strong> is calculated from the entropy and the first few bits are appended to the end</li>
              <li>The combined bit string (entropy + checksum) is divided into <strong>11-bit segments</strong></li>
              <li>Each 11-bit segment represents a number between 0 and 2,047</li>
              <li>Each number maps to a specific word on the BIP39 wordlist</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Because 2<sup>11</sup> = 2,048, every possible 11-bit value has a corresponding word. The mapping is entirely deterministic &mdash; the same bits always produce the same word in the same position.</p>
            <h3>The BIP39 Wordlist</h3>
            <p>The English BIP39 wordlist was carefully curated with specific rules to minimize human error:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each word is uniquely identifiable by its <strong>first four characters</strong> (no two words share the same prefix)</li>
              <li>Visually similar words (like "woman" and "women") were excluded</li>
              <li>Common, easy-to-spell words were prioritized</li>
              <li>Wordlists also exist in Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, Italian, Czech, and Portuguese</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 id="b-order" class="anim-fade-in">Why Does Order Matter?</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>The order of your seed words is <strong>absolutely critical</strong>. Changing the position of even a single word produces a completely different wallet with entirely different keys and addresses. Your original funds would be inaccessible.</p>
            <div class="callout callout-warning">
              <span class="callout-label">Important</span>
              Always write your words down in the exact order they appear. Number each word (1, 2, 3&hellip;) to avoid confusion when restoring your wallet. Double-check each word against what the wallet displays before proceeding.
            </div>
            <p>To understand the scale of security this provides: a 12-word seed phrase has <code>2048<sup>12</sup></code> possible combinations &mdash; approximately 5.4 &times; 10<sup>39</sup>. For comparison, the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe is roughly 10<sup>80</sup>. Brute-forcing even a 12-word phrase is computationally infeasible with any known or foreseeable technology.</p>
            <p>A 24-word phrase raises this to approximately 2.96 &times; 10<sup>79</sup> combinations, providing a security margin that is practically absolute.</p>

          <h2 id="b-checksum" class="anim-fade-in">The Checksum &mdash; Built-In Error Detection</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>One of the most elegant features of BIP39 is the <strong>checksum</strong> &mdash; a built-in error-detection mechanism that catches mistakes when you enter your seed phrase.</p>
            <p>The last word of your seed phrase is <em>partially</em> determined by the checksum. This means that not all combinations of 12 or 24 BIP39 words form a valid seed phrase. If you accidentally misspell a word, swap two words, or transcribe a word incorrectly, the checksum will almost certainly fail &mdash; and the wallet will alert you to the error instead of generating a wrong wallet.</p>
            <blockquote><p>The checksum is like a check digit on a credit card number. It does not make the system more secure against attackers, but it protects <em>you</em> from your own transcription mistakes.</p></blockquote>
            <div class="callout callout-info">
              <span class="callout-label">Note</span>
              For a 12-word phrase, the checksum is 4 bits long. For a 24-word phrase, it is 8 bits. This means roughly 1 in 16 random 12-word combinations would pass the checksum by chance &mdash; but a single-character typo in a real phrase will almost always be caught.

            <p>Your seed phrase is the single most valuable piece of information in your crypto setup. How you store it determines whether your funds are safe for decades or vulnerable to a single mistake.</p>

              <li>Consider creating <strong>multiple copies</strong> in geographically separate locations for disaster resilience</li>
              <li>Never store digitally &mdash; no photos, no cloud storage, no text files, no password managers</li>

            <h3>What to Avoid</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Taking a screenshot or photo of the seed phrase</li>
              <li>Typing it into any website, app, or form (except during legitimate wallet recovery)</li>
              <li>Sending it via email, messaging apps, or any digital channel</li>
              <li>Storing it alongside your hardware wallet (defeats the purpose of separate backup)</li>

          <h2 id="a-entropy" class="anim-fade-in">Entropy Sources and CSPRNG</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>BIP39 seed generation begins with a <strong>cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator</strong> (CSPRNG). The quality of the entropy source is the foundation of the entire security model &mdash; if the randomness is predictable or biased, the resulting seed phrase is compromised regardless of word count.</p>
            <h3>Platform-Specific Entropy Sources</h3>
            <p>On modern systems, CSPRNGs are typically backed by operating system entropy pools:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>/dev/urandom</code> on Linux &mdash; draws from the kernel entropy pool seeded by hardware interrupts, disk timing, and other sources</li>
              <li><code>CryptGenRandom</code> / <code>BCryptGenRandom</code> on Windows &mdash; backed by the Windows CNG provider</li>
              <li><code>SecRandomCopyBytes</code> on macOS/iOS &mdash; Secure Enclave-backed on devices with the T2/M-series chip</li>
              <li><code>crypto.getRandomValues()</code> via the Web Crypto API in browsers &mdash; delegates to the OS CSPRNG</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Entropy Length and Word Count</h3>
            <p>The entropy length directly determines the mnemonic word count. Each additional 32 bits of entropy adds exactly 3 words and 1 checksum bit:</p>
            <pre><code>ENT (bits)  CS (bits)  Total bits  Words
────────────────────────────────────────
128         4          132         12
160         5          165         15
192         6          198         18
224         7          231         21
256         8          264         24</code></pre>
            <p>The formula is: <code>CS = ENT / 32</code>, and <code>words = (ENT + CS) / 11</code>.</p>
            <div class="callout callout-warning">
              <span class="callout-label">Security Warning</span>
              Never generate entropy from user-chosen patterns, brain wallets, or low-entropy sources. Predictable inputs collapse the search space from 2<sup>128</sup> to a trivially brute-forceable range. Always use a CSPRNG.

          <h2 id="a-checksum" class="anim-fade-in">SHA-256 Checksum Mechanism</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>After generating raw entropy, the system computes a <strong>SHA-256 hash</strong> of the entropy bytes. The first <em>N</em> bits of this hash (where <code>N = entropy_bits / 32</code>) are appended to the entropy as a checksum.</p>
            <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Generate <code>ENT</code> bits of random entropy (e.g., 128 bits)</li>
              <li>Compute <code>H = SHA-256(entropy_bytes)</code></li>
              <li>Take the first <code>ENT/32</code> bits of <code>H</code> as the checksum</li>
              <li>Concatenate: <code>entropy_bits || checksum_bits</code></li>
              <li>Split the result into 11-bit groups</li>
              <li>Map each 11-bit value to the corresponding BIP39 word</li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote><p>The checksum ensures that approximately 15 out of every 16 randomly chosen 12-word combinations (for 4-bit checksum) will be invalid. This error-detection capability catches accidental transcription mistakes during recovery, though it is not a security mechanism against deliberate attacks.</p></blockquote>
            <h3>Validation During Recovery</h3>
            <p>When a user enters a seed phrase for recovery, the wallet reverses the process: it converts words back to 11-bit indices, separates the checksum bits, recomputes the SHA-256 hash of the entropy portion, and verifies that the extracted checksum matches. A mismatch indicates a typo, missing word, or incorrect word order.</p>
            <div class="callout callout-info">
              <span class="callout-label">Technical Note</span>
              The checksum covers only data integrity, not authenticity. It cannot detect if the entropy source was weak or compromised. A valid checksum only means the word combination is structurally correct, not that the underlying randomness was sufficient.

          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>The mnemonic phrase is not used directly as a cryptographic key. Instead, it undergoes a key-stretching process to produce a <strong>512-bit seed</strong>, which then feeds into hierarchical deterministic key derivation.</p>
            <h3>PBKDF2 Key Stretching</h3>
            <p>The mnemonic string (space-separated words, UTF-8 NFKD-normalized) is passed through <code>PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512</code> with <strong>2,048 iterations</strong>. The salt is the string <code>"mnemonic"</code> concatenated with an optional user-supplied passphrase (the "25th word"):</p>
            <pre><code>seed = PBKDF2(
  password: mnemonic_string,     // "abandon ability able ..."
  salt:     "mnemonic" + passphrase, // "mnemonic" or "mnemonicMySecret"
  iterations: 2048,
  dkLen:    64,                  // 512 bits
  PRF:      HMAC-SHA512
)</code></pre>
            <p>The 2,048 iterations provide a deliberate computational cost that slows down brute-force attempts against weak passphrases, while remaining fast enough for legitimate use.</p>
            <h3>BIP32 Master Key Derivation</h3>
            <p>The 512-bit seed is fed into <code>HMAC-SHA512</code> with the key <code>"Bitcoin seed"</code>. The output is split into two 256-bit halves:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Left 256 bits</strong> &mdash; the master private key</li>
              <li><strong>Right 256 bits</strong> &mdash; the master chain code (used for child derivation)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Derivation Paths (BIP44/BIP84/BIP86)</h3>
            <p>The master key feeds into BIP32 hierarchical deterministic key derivation. Standardized paths determine which specific key pair is generated for each coin and account:</p>
            <pre><code>m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index

m/44'/0'/0'/0/0   &larr; Bitcoin Legacy (P2PKH)
m/44'/60'/0'/0/0  &larr; Ethereum
m/49'/0'/0'/0/0   &larr; Bitcoin Nested SegWit (P2SH-P2WPKH)
m/84'/0'/0'/0/0   &larr; Bitcoin Native SegWit (P2WPKH)
m/86'/0'/0'/0/0   &larr; Bitcoin Taproot (P2TR)</code></pre>
            <p>Each path segment narrows from the master key to a specific purpose, coin, account, and address index. The apostrophe (<code>'</code>) indicates hardened derivation, which prevents child key compromise from leaking parent key information.</p>

              In practice, the English wordlist is the de facto standard. Most hardware wallets and popular software wallets only support the English list. If cross-wallet compatibility is important, stick with English.

          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>Understanding the threat landscape for seed phrases helps calibrate security decisions. The primary attack vectors are:</p>
            <h3>Brute-Force Attacks</h3>
            <p>A 128-bit entropy seed (12 words) provides a search space of 2<sup>128</sup> &asymp; 3.4 &times; 10<sup>38</sup> possible keys. At 10 billion guesses per second (far beyond current capability for full key derivation), exhausting this space would take approximately 10<sup>21</sup> years. This is secure against any classical computing attack.</p>
            <h3>Partial Knowledge Attacks</h3>
            <p>If an attacker knows <em>some</em> words of your seed phrase, the remaining search space shrinks dramatically:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>11 of 12 words known</strong> &mdash; 2,048 candidates (trivially brute-forceable)</li>
              <li><strong>10 of 12 words known</strong> &mdash; ~4.2 million candidates (seconds to crack)</li>
              <li><strong>8 of 12 words known</strong> &mdash; ~1.76 &times; 10<sup>13</sup> candidates (days to weeks)</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout callout-warning">
              <span class="callout-label">Security Warning</span>
              Never split your seed phrase into parts thinking each part is independently secure. If an attacker obtains any significant portion, the remaining entropy may be brute-forceable. Use Shamir's Secret Sharing (SLIP39) instead for threshold-based backup splitting.
            </div>
            <h3>Side-Channel and Social Attacks</h3>
            <p>In practice, most seed phrase compromises do not involve brute-force. They come from phishing (fake wallet recovery pages), malware (clipboard hijacking, keyloggers), physical theft of backup material, and social engineering. Strong entropy is necessary but not sufficient &mdash; operational security is equally critical.</p>

Even accounting for future quantum computing, Grover's algorithm would only halve the effective security to 64 bits for key search &mdash; still formidable, and mitigated by the PBKDF2 key-stretching step.
