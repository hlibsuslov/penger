          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>The most fundamental distinction in wallet types is whether the private keys are ever exposed to an internet-connected device.</p>
            <h3>Hot Wallets</h3>
            <p><strong>Hot wallets</strong> are connected to the internet &mdash; mobile apps, browser extensions, desktop software. They provide convenience for everyday transactions but introduce risk because the keys exist on a device that could be compromised by malware, phishing, or remote exploits.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mobile wallets</strong> (e.g., BlueWallet, Muun) &mdash; portable, QR code scanning, ideal for in-person payments</li>
              <li><strong>Browser extensions</strong> (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby) &mdash; direct interaction with DeFi protocols and dApps</li>
              <li><strong>Desktop wallets</strong> (e.g., Sparrow, Electrum) &mdash; full-featured, larger display, suitable for advanced UTXO management</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cold Storage</h3>
            <p><strong>Cold storage</strong> keeps your private keys completely offline &mdash; on hardware wallets, air-gapped computers, or physical media like metal seed plates. The keys never touch a network-connected device, making them immune to remote attacks.</p>
            <blockquote><p>A practical strategy is to maintain a small "spending" balance in a hot wallet for daily use, while keeping the majority of holdings in cold storage &mdash; like carrying pocket cash while the rest stays in a vault.</p></blockquote>
            <div class="callout callout-tip">
              <span class="callout-label">Rule of Thumb</span>
              Only keep in a hot wallet what you can afford to lose. If you wouldn't carry that amount in cash on the street, it should be in cold storage.

          <h2 class="anim-fade-in" id="b-hardware">Hardware Wallets</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>Hardware wallets are dedicated physical devices designed with a single purpose: securely storing private keys and signing transactions. They contain a <strong>secure element chip</strong> that isolates key material from the host computer.</p>
            <h3>How They Work</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>A <strong>companion app</strong> on your computer or phone prepares the transaction (recipient, amount, fee)</li>
              <li>The unsigned transaction is sent to the hardware wallet via USB, Bluetooth, or QR code</li>
              <li>The device displays transaction details on its own <strong>trusted screen</strong> for verification</li>
              <li>You physically confirm on the device (button press or touchscreen)</li>
              <li>The device signs the transaction internally using the secure element</li>
              <li>Only the <strong>signed transaction</strong> is returned &mdash; the private key never leaves the device</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Key Features to Evaluate</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Secure element</strong> &mdash; does the device use a certified chip (CC EAL5+ or equivalent)?</li>
              <li><strong>Open-source firmware</strong> &mdash; can the community audit the code?</li>
              <li><strong>Air-gap capability</strong> &mdash; can the device sign via QR codes without any cable connection?</li>
              <li><strong>Multi-coin support</strong> &mdash; does it support the blockchains you use?</li>
              <li><strong>Trusted display</strong> &mdash; does the device have its own screen for verifying transaction details?</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout callout-warning">
              <span class="callout-label">Supply Chain Safety</span>
              Always purchase hardware wallets <strong>directly from the manufacturer</strong>. Third-party sellers, marketplace listings, and "used" devices introduce supply chain risk &mdash; the device may have been tampered with to extract your keys silently.

          <h2 class="anim-fade-in" id="b-custody">Custodial vs. Self-Custodial</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>The distinction between custodial and self-custodial is perhaps the most important decision in crypto. It determines who ultimately controls your funds.</p>
            <h3>Custodial Wallets</h3>
            <p>With a <strong>custodial wallet</strong> (exchange accounts like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken), a third party holds your private keys. This is convenient &mdash; no seed phrases to manage, easy password recovery &mdash; but introduces <strong>counterparty risk</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The exchange could be <strong>hacked</strong> (Mt. Gox lost 850,000 BTC in 2014)</li>
              <li>The company could become <strong>insolvent</strong> (FTX collapsed in 2022, losing $8B+ in customer funds)</li>
              <li>Your account could be <strong>frozen</strong> due to regulatory action, compliance issues, or internal policy</li>
              <li><strong>Withdrawal limits</strong> or delays may prevent you from accessing your own funds</li>
              <li>You have no cryptographic proof of ownership &mdash; just a database entry</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Self-Custodial Wallets</h3>
            <p><strong>Self-custodial wallets</strong> give you full control. You hold your keys, you own your assets &mdash; no intermediary can block access, freeze funds, or deny withdrawals. The trade-off is full responsibility: if you lose your seed phrase, no one can help you recover.</p>
            <blockquote><p>"Not your keys, not your coins." This phrase captures the fundamental principle of self-custody: if you don't control the private keys, you don't truly own the cryptocurrency &mdash; you hold an IOU from a third party.</p></blockquote>

          <h2 class="anim-fade-in" id="b-choosing">Choosing the Right Wallet</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>There is no single "best" wallet &mdash; the right choice depends on your holdings, usage patterns, and threat model.</p>
            <h3>For Beginners</h3>
            <p>Start with a reputable <strong>self-custodial mobile wallet</strong>. Learn the basics: receiving, sending, backing up your seed phrase. Practice with small amounts before moving larger sums.</p>
            <h3>For Regular Users</h3>
            <p>Combine a <strong>hardware wallet</strong> for savings with a <strong>hot wallet</strong> for daily spending. The hardware wallet holds the bulk of your funds in cold storage; the hot wallet holds what you need for the week.</p>
            <h3>For High-Value Holdings</h3>
            <p>Consider <strong>multi-signature</strong> setups (2-of-3 or 3-of-5), <strong>air-gapped signing</strong>, and <strong>geographically distributed backups</strong>. Use a BIP39 passphrase to create hidden wallets. Document your setup for inheritance planning.</p>
            <div class="callout callout-info">
              <span class="callout-label">Key Principle</span>
              Security should scale with holdings. A $500 portfolio doesn't need the same setup as a $500,000 portfolio. Over-engineering small amounts wastes time; under-securing large amounts risks catastrophic loss.

          <h2 id="a-multisig" class="anim-fade-in">Multi-Signature (Multi-Sig) Wallets</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>Multi-sig wallets require <strong>M-of-N signatures</strong> to authorize a transaction. The spending conditions are encoded directly into the Bitcoin script, meaning the blockchain itself enforces the policy &mdash; no single compromised key can move funds.</p>
            <h3>Common Configurations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>2-of-3</strong> &mdash; ideal for personal use. Keys distributed across three locations (e.g., phone, hardware wallet, metal backup in a safe). Any two can sign, so losing one doesn't lock you out.</li>
              <li><strong>3-of-5</strong> &mdash; suited for organizations. Five key holders (board members, executives), any three must approve. Tolerates two simultaneous compromises or losses.</li>
              <li><strong>2-of-2</strong> &mdash; collaborative custody or family setups where both parties must agree to spend.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Script Implementations</h3>
            <p>Bitcoin supports native multi-sig through several script types:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>P2SH</code> &mdash; the multi-sig script is hashed and the hash goes on-chain. The full script and all signatures are provided at spending time.</li>
              <li><code>P2WSH</code> &mdash; SegWit version, moves witness data to save block space and reduce fees.</li>
              <li><code>P2TR</code> (Taproot) &mdash; with MuSig2 key aggregation, an M-of-N setup can appear as a single-signature output on-chain when all parties cooperate, improving privacy and reducing fees. The multi-sig fallback is encoded in a Tapscript leaf.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout callout-warning">
              <span class="callout-label">Recovery Complexity</span>
              Multi-sig wallets require not just the seed phrases but also the <strong>wallet configuration file</strong> (often called the "wallet descriptor" or "multisig coordination file") containing the xpubs of all cosigners, the quorum policy (M-of-N), and derivation paths. Back up this file alongside your seeds.

        <div class="container">
          <h2 id="a-airgap" class="anim-fade-in">Air-Gapped Signing and PSBTs</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>Air-gapped wallets provide the strongest isolation by ensuring the signing device <strong>never connects to any network</strong> &mdash; not via USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or NFC. Transactions are transferred via QR codes or microSD cards using the <strong>PSBT format</strong> (BIP174 / BIP370).</p>
            <h3>PSBT Workflow</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>The <strong>watch-only wallet</strong> (online) creates an <strong>unsigned PSBT</strong> containing transaction inputs, outputs, and metadata</li>
              <li>The PSBT is transferred to the air-gapped signer via <strong>animated QR codes</strong> or SD card</li>
              <li>The signer validates the transaction on its <strong>trusted display</strong>, adds its signature, and outputs a partially or fully signed PSBT</li>
              <li>The signed PSBT is transferred back to the watch-only wallet</li>
              <li>The wallet finalizes and broadcasts the fully signed transaction to the network</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>PSBT Structure</h3>
            <p>A PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction) is a serialization format that carries all information needed for a signer to validate and sign:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Global fields</strong> &mdash; unsigned transaction, xpub metadata</li>
              <li><strong>Per-input fields</strong> &mdash; UTXO details, derivation paths, partial signatures, redeem/witness scripts</li>
              <li><strong>Per-output fields</strong> &mdash; derivation paths for change outputs (so the signer can verify change goes back to the same wallet)</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote><p>The PSBT format is what makes multi-sig and air-gapped setups practical. Multiple signers can each add their signature independently, without ever needing to be online at the same time or share private keys.</p></blockquote>

        <div class="container">
          <h2 id="a-mpc" class="anim-fade-in">MPC Wallets and Threshold Signatures</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p><strong>Multi-Party Computation</strong> (MPC) wallets split the key generation and signing process across multiple parties using cryptographic protocols. Unlike multi-sig, the complete private key <strong>never exists in one place</strong> &mdash; not even during key generation.</p>
            <h3>How MPC Signing Works</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Distributed Key Generation (DKG)</strong> &mdash; each party generates a key share. The shares are created through an interactive protocol where no single party sees the full key.</li>
              <li><strong>Threshold Signing</strong> &mdash; to sign a transaction, a threshold of parties (e.g., 2 of 3) run an interactive signing protocol. Each contributes a partial signature from their share.</li>
              <li><strong>Signature Combination</strong> &mdash; the partial signatures are combined into a standard ECDSA or Schnorr signature that is indistinguishable from a single-signer signature on-chain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>MPC vs. Multi-Sig</h3>
            <div class="callout callout-info">
              <span class="callout-label">Key Differences</span>
              Multi-sig encodes the M-of-N policy in the blockchain script &mdash; it is visible on-chain and requires blockchain-specific support. MPC produces standard single-signature transactions, meaning it works across <strong>any blockchain</strong> (including those without native multi-sig), reduces fees, and reveals nothing about the signing setup. The trade-off is more complex key management and the need for interactive signing sessions.
            </div>
            <h3>Use Cases</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Institutional custody</strong> &mdash; distribute signing authority across geographic regions and organizational roles</li>
              <li><strong>Cross-chain security</strong> &mdash; enforce threshold policies on chains that don't support multi-sig natively</li>
              <li><strong>Key rotation</strong> &mdash; MPC supports proactive share refresh, allowing key shares to be rotated without changing the on-chain address</li>

          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>The security of a hardware wallet ultimately depends on its <strong>hardware architecture</strong> and the integrity of its firmware. Two critical components:</p>
            <h3>Secure Element (SE)</h3>
            <p>A secure element is a tamper-resistant chip designed to store and process sensitive data. Key properties:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Side-channel resistance</strong> &mdash; shielded against power analysis, electromagnetic emissions, and timing attacks</li>
              <li><strong>Fault injection protection</strong> &mdash; detects voltage glitching, laser fault injection, and clock manipulation</li>
              <li><strong>Certified evaluation</strong> &mdash; chips like the ST31/ST33 series undergo Common Criteria certification (EAL5+/EAL6+)</li>
              <li><strong>Monotonic counter</strong> &mdash; prevents rollback attacks on firmware versions</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Firmware Verification</h3>
            <p>Before trusting a hardware wallet, verify the firmware is authentic and unmodified:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Deterministic builds</strong> &mdash; open-source wallets allow anyone to compile the firmware and compare the hash against the released binary</li>
              <li><strong>Signed firmware updates</strong> &mdash; the device should only accept updates cryptographically signed by the manufacturer</li>
              <li><strong>Attestation</strong> &mdash; some devices support remote attestation, proving the secure element is running expected code</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout callout-tip">
              <span class="callout-label">Evaluation Tip</span>
              The most secure hardware wallet is one that combines an open-source firmware (auditable by the community) with a certified secure element (resistant to physical attacks). Avoid devices where either the firmware or the chip is proprietary and unauditable.

Supply chain attacks &mdash; buying a tampered device from an untrusted seller &mdash; are a more practical concern. Remote hacking of a properly designed hardware wallet is essentially impossible because the device has no network interface. Always buy directly from the manufacturer and verify firmware integrity upon first setup."></div>
