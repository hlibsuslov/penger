          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p><strong>Operational security</strong> (OpSec) is the practice of protecting sensitive information by identifying vulnerabilities and eliminating them before an adversary can exploit them. Originally a military concept, OpSec has become essential for anyone holding significant value in cryptocurrency.</p>
            <p>In crypto, OpSec spans three interconnected domains:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Digital security</strong> &mdash; protecting your devices, accounts, and online identity from hacking, malware, and phishing</li>
              <li><strong>Physical security</strong> &mdash; protecting your seed phrase backup, hardware wallet, and physical environment from theft, fire, and natural disaster</li>
              <li><strong>Social security</strong> &mdash; controlling what information you reveal about your holdings, habits, and identity to prevent targeted attacks</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote><p>The question is not just "is my wallet secure?" but "who might want my keys, how might they attempt to get them, and what am I doing to make their job harder?"</p></blockquote>
            <p>Good OpSec is not about being paranoid &mdash; it is about being <strong>methodical</strong>. You systematically identify what you're protecting, who you're protecting it from, and what practical steps reduce your risk surface.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="container">
          <h2 id="b-threats" class="anim-fade-in">Threat Modeling Basics</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>Before implementing security measures, you need to understand <strong>what you're protecting against</strong>. A threat model is a structured way of thinking about risk. Ask yourself:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>What am I protecting?</strong> &mdash; seed phrases, private keys, hardware wallets, account access</li>
              <li><strong>Who might want to steal it?</strong> &mdash; hackers, scammers, criminals, insiders</li>
              <li><strong>What methods would they use?</strong> &mdash; phishing, malware, physical theft, coercion</li>
              <li><strong>What is the impact if they succeed?</strong> &mdash; total loss, partial loss, privacy breach</li>
              <li><strong>What am I willing to invest in prevention?</strong> &mdash; time, money, convenience trade-offs</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Common Threat Actors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Opportunistic hackers</strong> &mdash; automated scanning for weak passwords, exposed keys, and phishing victims. They cast a wide net and rely on volume.</li>
              <li><strong>Targeted attackers</strong> &mdash; individuals or groups who know (or suspect) you hold significant crypto. They invest time in reconnaissance and custom attacks.</li>
              <li><strong>Phishers and scammers</strong> &mdash; impersonating exchanges, wallet providers, or support staff to trick you into revealing credentials or seed phrases.</li>
              <li><strong>Physical attackers</strong> &mdash; may resort to coercion, extortion, or the "$5 wrench attack" (physical violence to force compliance). This is why you should never publicly disclose your holdings.</li>
              <li><strong>Insiders</strong> &mdash; family members, roommates, or colleagues who may have physical access to your backup material.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout callout-tip">
              <span class="callout-label">Practical Tip</span>
              Your threat model should be proportional to your holdings. Someone holding $500 in crypto faces different threats than someone holding $500,000. Scale your security measures accordingly &mdash; but build good habits from the start.

          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>Most crypto theft happens through digital attack vectors. Building strong habits here provides the highest return on security investment.</p>
            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Use a <strong>password manager</strong> to generate and store unique, random passwords for every account</li>
              <li>Enable <strong>two-factor authentication</strong> (2FA) on every crypto-related account &mdash; exchange, email, cloud storage</li>
              <li>Use <strong>hardware security keys</strong> (FIDO2/WebAuthn) instead of SMS or TOTP codes whenever possible &mdash; hardware keys are phishing-resistant</li>
              <li>Never use SMS-based 2FA for high-value accounts &mdash; SIM-swap attacks can bypass it trivially</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Device Security</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep operating systems and wallet software <strong>up to date</strong> &mdash; security patches are released for a reason</li>
              <li>Use <strong>full-disk encryption</strong> on all devices (FileVault on macOS, BitLocker on Windows, LUKS on Linux)</li>
              <li>Avoid installing unnecessary software, browser extensions, or mobile apps &mdash; each is a potential attack surface</li>
              <li>Use a dedicated browser profile (or separate browser) for crypto activities &mdash; isolated from your general browsing</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout callout-warning">
              <span class="callout-label">Phishing Alert</span>
              No legitimate wallet, exchange, or support team will ever ask for your seed phrase, private key, or password. Anyone who asks for these is attempting to steal your funds. This rule has zero exceptions.

          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>Your seed phrase backup is the <strong>most critical physical item</strong> in your crypto setup. If it is lost, stolen, or destroyed, your funds may be permanently inaccessible.</p>
            <h3>Storage Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Record your seed on a <strong>durable medium</strong> &mdash; stamped or engraved metal plates resist fire (up to 1,500&deg;C), water, and corrosion far better than paper</li>
              <li>Store in a <strong>fireproof, waterproof safe</strong> that you control</li>
              <li>Maintain <strong>geographically separated copies</strong> to protect against localized disasters (fire, flood, earthquake)</li>
              <li>Consider a <strong>safety deposit box</strong> or trusted second location for one backup copy</li>
              <li>If using a BIP39 passphrase, store it <strong>separately</strong> from the seed phrase &mdash; an attacker who finds both can access your funds</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout callout-warning">
              <span class="callout-label">Never Do This</span>
              Never store a photo of your seed phrase on your phone. Never put it in cloud storage (iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox). Never type it into any website. Never email or message it to anyone. Every digital copy is a permanent liability.
            </div>
            <h3>Hardware Wallet Physical Security</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Store your hardware wallet in a location <strong>separate</strong> from your seed backup (so a single burglary doesn't compromise both)</li>
              <li>Use the device PIN to protect against casual physical access</li>
              <li>Enable the <strong>auto-wipe feature</strong> (if available) that erases the device after a set number of incorrect PIN attempts</li>
              <li>Check packaging integrity when receiving a new device &mdash; look for signs of tampering, broken seals, or pre-initialized state</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p><strong>Social engineering</strong> is the manipulation of people to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise security. In crypto, it is one of the most effective and common attack vectors.</p>
            <h3>Key Rules</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Never disclose your holdings</strong> publicly &mdash; on social media, forums, in-person conversations, or anywhere that could reach an attacker. You become a target the moment someone knows you have significant crypto.</li>
              <li><strong>Verify before trusting</strong> &mdash; always independently verify the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information. Don't trust caller ID, email addresses, or display names.</li>
              <li><strong>Be skeptical of urgency</strong> &mdash; scammers create artificial time pressure ("your account is compromised, act now!") to bypass your critical thinking.</li>
              <li><strong>Never share your screen</strong> during wallet operations, and never allow "remote support" to access your device.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Common Social Engineering Tactics</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Impersonation</strong> &mdash; pretending to be exchange support, wallet developers, or government officials</li>
              <li><strong>Fake giveaways</strong> &mdash; "send 0.1 BTC, receive 1.0 BTC back" scams are ubiquitous and always fraudulent</li>
              <li><strong>Compromised accounts</strong> &mdash; a friend's hacked social media sends you a malicious link or seed phrase request</li>
              <li><strong>Fake wallet apps</strong> &mdash; cloned apps in app stores that look identical to legitimate wallets but steal your keys</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote><p>The best defense against social engineering is a simple rule: if anyone asks for your seed phrase, private key, or password for any reason whatsoever, the answer is always "no."</p></blockquote>

            <p>Every piece of public information about your crypto holdings <strong>increases your attack surface</strong>. Advanced OpSec involves systematically reducing the data trail that connects your identity to your funds.</p>
            <h3>Identity Segregation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Use <strong>separate email addresses</strong> for crypto accounts, never linked to your real name or primary email</li>
              <li>Use <strong>unique usernames</strong> for crypto-related forums and social media &mdash; never reuse identifiers from your personal accounts</li>
              <li>Consider <strong>privacy-focused email providers</strong> that don't require phone verification or personal information</li>
              <li>Use a <strong>VPN or Tor</strong> for crypto-related browsing to prevent IP-based correlation</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Transaction Privacy</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Never reuse Bitcoin addresses &mdash; use a fresh address for each receive</li>
              <li>Be aware of <strong>chain analysis</strong> &mdash; blockchain transactions are public, and companies specialize in linking addresses to identities</li>
              <li>Use <strong>CoinJoin</strong> or similar privacy-enhancing techniques for Bitcoin transactions when privacy is critical</li>
              <li>Avoid moving funds between KYC-linked exchange addresses and privacy-focused wallets in easily traceable patterns</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout callout-tip">
              <span class="callout-label">Pro Tip</span>
              For high-value setups, use a <strong>dedicated device</strong> (phone or laptop) exclusively for crypto operations. This device should never browse the general web, access social media, or install non-essential software. Treat it as a purpose-built secure terminal.

          <h2 id="a-ceremony" class="anim-fade-in">Key Ceremony Procedures</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>A <strong>key ceremony</strong> is a deliberate, documented process for generating and storing cryptographic keys. For high-value setups, this should be treated as a formal procedure with defined steps and verification checkpoints.</p>
            <h3>Single-Sig Key Ceremony</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Prepare a <strong>dedicated offline device</strong> (freshly installed OS or verified hardware wallet firmware)</li>
              <li><strong>Verify wallet software integrity</strong> &mdash; check the binary hash against the developer's signed release, verify GPG signatures</li>
              <li>Conduct generation in a <strong>private, camera-free location</strong></li>
              <li>Generate the seed phrase and <strong>immediately create physical backups</strong> on durable media (metal plates)</li>
              <li><strong>Verify the backup</strong> &mdash; restore from the written seed on a separate device and confirm the first few addresses match</li>
              <li>Store backups in <strong>separate secure locations</strong> before bringing any device online</li>
              <li><strong>Document the procedure</strong> (without recording the seed) for future reference and inheritance planning</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Multi-Sig Key Ceremony</h3>
            <p>Multi-sig ceremonies are more complex because each key must be generated independently:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each key should be generated on a <strong>different device</strong>, ideally from a <strong>different manufacturer</strong></li>
              <li>Key generation should happen in <strong>different physical locations</strong> and ideally by <strong>different individuals</strong></li>
              <li>The <strong>wallet descriptor file</strong> (containing all xpubs and the quorum policy) must be backed up alongside each seed</li>
              <li>Test the multi-sig setup by sending a small amount and <strong>completing a full spend</strong> before committing significant funds</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote><p>A key ceremony is an investment of time that pays dividends in security confidence. Rushing the process or cutting corners during key generation is where most catastrophic errors originate.</p></blockquote>

          <h2 id="a-defense" class="anim-fade-in">Multi-Layer Defense Strategy</h2>
          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p><strong>Defense in depth</strong> applies multiple independent security layers so an attacker must compromise all of them &mdash; and failure of any single layer does not result in total loss.</p>
            <h3>Security Layer Stack</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Layer 1 &mdash; Device security</strong>: Full-disk encryption, biometric unlock, locked BIOS/firmware, secure boot chain</li>
              <li><strong>Layer 2 &mdash; Authentication</strong>: Strong unique passwords, FIDO2 hardware keys, app-specific 2FA</li>
              <li><strong>Layer 3 &mdash; Isolated signing</strong>: Hardware wallet or air-gapped device &mdash; private keys never on a networked machine</li>
              <li><strong>Layer 4 &mdash; Backup security</strong>: Metal seed plates in geographically separated, access-controlled locations</li>
              <li><strong>Layer 5 &mdash; Passphrase layer</strong>: A BIP39 passphrase (25th word) means the seed alone is insufficient to access funds</li>
              <li><strong>Layer 6 &mdash; Social layer</strong>: Minimizing knowledge of your holdings, using decoy wallets, maintaining a low profile</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Plausible Deniability</h3>
            <p>A BIP39 passphrase enables the creation of <strong>decoy wallets</strong>. Your base seed phrase (without passphrase) can lead to a wallet with a small, plausible balance. Your actual holdings exist on a different derivation created by the passphrase. Under coercion, you can reveal the base seed phrase while keeping the passphrase-protected wallet hidden.</p>
            <div class="callout callout-info">
              <span class="callout-label">Duress Planning</span>
              For high-value holders, having a convincing decoy wallet with a moderate balance is a practical countermeasure against physical coercion. The attacker sees a legitimate wallet and has no way to prove additional funds exist elsewhere.

            <p>Self-custody means your heirs cannot simply call a bank or exchange to claim assets. Without explicit planning, your crypto holdings could be <strong>permanently lost</strong> upon your incapacitation or death.</p>
            <h3>Inheritance Planning Approaches</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Letter of instruction</strong> &mdash; a sealed document stored with your will that explains your setup, the location of seed backups, and step-by-step recovery instructions. Written for a technically competent executor.</li>
              <li><strong>Multi-sig inheritance</strong> &mdash; in a 2-of-3 setup, one key is held by a trusted family member, one by a lawyer, and one by yourself. Upon your death, the family member and lawyer can cooperate to access funds.</li>
              <li><strong>Shamir's Secret Sharing</strong> &mdash; SLIP39 shares distributed to multiple heirs/trustees. A threshold of shares can reconstruct the seed after a documented triggering event.</li>
              <li><strong>Timelock contracts</strong> &mdash; on-chain contracts that release funds to a specified address after a certain block height or time, unless periodically "refreshed" by the owner (a dead man's switch).</li>

              Test your inheritance plan. Have your designated executor (or a trusted proxy) perform a complete mock recovery using your documentation. If they cannot follow the instructions successfully, your heirs will not be able to access the funds when it matters.

          <div class="guide-text anim-fade-in">
            <p>A core principle of crypto security: <strong>don't trust, verify</strong>. Every piece of software, hardware, and information should be independently verified before you trust it with your keys.</p>
            <h3>Software Verification</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Download from official sources only</strong> &mdash; use the project's official website or verified GitHub repository, never third-party mirrors or app store clones</li>
              <li><strong>Verify checksums</strong> &mdash; compare the SHA-256 hash of downloaded files against the publisher's signed release notes</li>
              <li><strong>Verify GPG signatures</strong> &mdash; confirm the release was signed by the expected developer key</li>
              <li><strong>Reproducible builds</strong> &mdash; for critical software, check if the project supports reproducible builds, allowing you to compile from source and verify it matches the distributed binary</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Address Verification</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Always verify the <strong>full address</strong> before sending &mdash; clipboard malware can silently replace the copied address with an attacker's address</li>
              <li>Use your hardware wallet's <strong>trusted display</strong> to confirm the address, not just the computer screen</li>
              <li>For large transfers, <strong>send a small test amount first</strong> and confirm receipt before sending the full amount</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout callout-tip">
              <span class="callout-label">Verification Habit</span>
              Make address verification a non-negotiable step in every transaction. Check at least the first 6 and last 6 characters of the address on both your computer screen and your hardware wallet display. This catches both clipboard malware and display-level attacks.

              <div class="faq-bubble" data-text="No. Public disclosure of holdings makes you a target for social engineering, phishing, SIM-swap attacks, and even physical coercion.

              <div class="faq-bubble" data-text="Password managers are excellent for account passwords and 2FA backup codes, but storing your seed phrase there is risky. If your master password is phished or your device is compromised, the attacker gains access to the seed. Seed phrases should exist only on physical media (stamped metal, hand-written paper) stored in secure offline locations. The principle is clear: seed phrases belong in the physical world, not the digital one."></div>

              <div class="faq-bubble" data-text="A $5 wrench attack (also called a rubber hose attack) refers to physical coercion &mdash; an attacker uses threats or violence to force you to hand over your keys. No amount of encryption protects against someone who can compel you to reveal your password. Countermeasures include: multi-sig (no single person holds all keys), decoy wallets (reveal a plausible small-balance wallet under duress), geographic distribution of keys, and most importantly &mdash; not advertising your holdings."></div>
